It utilizes Wake-On-LAN to turn on a computer by MAC address within the same LAN. Once the computer boots up and is added to the local ARP table, its global IP address can be determined. The IP address can be used to SSH into the computer."},"content":[{"type":"readme","html":"<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Download a WakeOnLan source directory (I used <a href=\"https://github.com/jpoliv/wakeonlan\">jpoliv's wakeonlan</a>).\nExtract the directory, read its README.md file, and follow the instructions given.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Run the provided initialization script:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ ./initialize\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>NOTE: This creates the ~/.wolrc configuration file.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Input your own machine's MAC address and the absolute path of your WakeOnLan's\nsource directory into the ~/.wolrc configuration file.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"turningonyourcomputer\">Turning on your computer</h2>\n\n<p>Assuming that the computer you are running this command from is connected\n  to the same LAN as your shutdown computer:\n  <code>\n$ ./wakecomponlan\n</code></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"findingyourcomputersipaddress\">Finding your computer's IP address</h2>\n\n<p>Assuming that the computer you are running this command from is connected\n  to the same LAN as your computer:\n  <code>\n$ ./iscomponline\n</code>\n  NOTE: Don't forget to give your computer some time to boot up (mine takes a few minutes!).\n  Also, you may need <a href=\"https://github.com/Krail/Heartbeat\">Heartbeat</a>, which pings your server so that your computer is quickly added to the ARP table.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"finally\">Finally</h2>\n\n<p>You can ssh from anywhere to your now online computer with:\n  <code>\n$ ssh [username]@[ip returned from ./iscomponline]\n</code></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"todo\">ToDo</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Combine prerequisites 2 and 3 into a query and answer with user.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Combine the <strong>iscomponline</strong> and <strong>ssh</strong> commands\nto make one single command.</p></li>\n</ol>"}]}
